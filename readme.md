## Explanation of Each Folder

## `cmd/`

Contains the entry point(s) for the application. For a single Telegram bot, this typically includes `main.go`, which initializes the bot and starts listening for updates.

---

## `config/`

Manages application configuration, such as API keys and other settings. Commonly uses libraries like `viper` or `godotenv` to load configurations from files like `config.yaml` or `.env`.

---

## `internal/`

Holds the main business logic and bot functionality. This folder is organized into subdirectories:

- **`bot/`**:  
  Contains core bot logic, including:

  - Message handlers
  - Middleware
  - Command processing

- **`services/`**:  
  Handles external integrations, such as APIs or database operations.

- **`utils/`**:  
  Includes helper functions and utilities, such as logging or string manipulation.

---

## `pkg/`

Contains reusable packages or components that could be used across different projects. Examples include:

- A Telegram API client wrapper
- Message formatting utilities

---

## `scripts/`

Stores shell or batch scripts for tasks like:

- Deployment
- Environment setup
- Database migrations
